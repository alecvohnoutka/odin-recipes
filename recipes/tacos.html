        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of the very first dishes I learned to cook were tacos. My older brother was a fitness fanatic; he began dragging me to the gym every once in a while, and the reward would be him cooking up some <strong>BOMB-ASS</strong> tacos. After many anxious nights, I finally took command of the kitchen and helped him make a batch. Like a reward for completing an NPC's quest, he gave me his secret spice mixture.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As any good younger brother would, I will now spill that secret spice combination to the Internet as part of my learn-to-code practicum.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Impossible beef (it's better for the environment ;^) )</li>
            <li>1 whole yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 bell peppers</li>
            <li>1 ice cold Miller High Life</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Smoked paprika</li>
            <li>Adobo powder</li>
            <li>Chili powder</li>
            <li>Ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Small corn tortillas</li>
            <li>One sprig fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>One lime</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thaw the Impossible beef for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dice the onion and peppers. Keep separate for now.</li>
            <li>Begin heating two pans on the range: one medium-sized saucepan with olive oil, and one large empty saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the onions to the pan with olive oil, sautee for a few minutes until the onions begin to sweat.</li>
            <li>Add the peppers to the pan with the onions; shake occasionally and monitor until cooked and fragrant. Set aside once done.</li>
            <li>In the other pan, add the package of Impossible beef, breaking into a fine ground with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is finely separated and ground, pour the beer into the skillet until the meat is covered (about 2/3 of a bottle). Enjoy the rest!</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is sauteeing in the beer.</li>
            <li>Add the spices in equal proportion, going heavy with the cumin and chili powder while going easy on the salt and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until the meat is thoroughly browned. Be sure to scrape the fond off the pan as it cooks, as that adds extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Heat the tortillas, either in a small skillet or in a toaster oven on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and peppers to the pan with the meat to finish. Let sit for a few minutes to cool.</li>
            <li>Take two tortillas, placing one atop the other. Scoop the meat, onions, and peppers onto the tortillas.</li>
            <li>Mince the cilantro and sprinkle over the tacos. Half the lime and squeeze over the tacos.</li>
        </ol>
