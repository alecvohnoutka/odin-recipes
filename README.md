# odin-recipes
First web dev project with The Odin Project.

This project is a very basic website containing a few recipes of my choosing and writing. From the index.html home page, you should be able to click the hyperlinks that will take you to three different recipes that I have written down. Each recipe has a cool picture that looks close enough to what the resultant dish should look like. Feel free to try them if you want! I'm not a professional chef nor a cookbook author by any means, but these are the few dishes I am able to cook pretty damn well. You can also navigate back to the homepage from each recipe. Maybe one day I'll feel adventurous enough to re-do this, but this is a satisfactory first attempt at covering the requirements.

The purpose of this exercise was to ensure that I could write HTML boilerplate from memory, add basic href linking functionality between directories (originating from the index.html master branch), and embed images from the same directory with descriptive alt text for users with screen readers (as well as search engine optimization). This was also a way to test my ability to both write and format text in HTML so it is readable on a web page, as well as create ordered and unordered lists. Creating this "website" from scratch was a ton of fun and required me to use parts of my brain that I haven't really used in a bit. It was pretty straightforward after completing the last few sections of The Odin Project coursework beforehand; great job teaching me, Complex Web of Kind Strangers!
